Problem statement As cities grow, efficient logistics and transport are vital for productivity and safety. A consulting firm must solve two key urban mobility challenges.

Logistics & Delivery Challenges 🚛 India ranks 38th in the Logistics Performance Index (LPI) 2023 ⏳ 40% of total delivery time is wasted in traffic congestion (NITI Aayog). 💰 Logistics costs in India are 14% of GDP, compared to 8-9% in developed countries (World Bank).
Urban Traffic & Public Transport Issues 🚗 Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru among the top 10 most congested cities globally (TomTom Traffic Index 2023). 🔥 2.5x increase in CO₂ emissions due to inefficient routes (Centre for Science and Environment). 🏥 India records 1.5 lakh road accident deaths (MoRTH Report 2023).

Context & Significance (Delhi’s Data) the same model can be easily adapted to other cities, states, and countries with minimal tweaks.

Urban Mobility & Logistics in Delhi: Delhi’s traffic congestion worsens delivery delays, impacting businesses and consumers. Warehouses struggle with rising demand & inefficient route planning. Peak-hour gridlocks at key choke points slow down last-mile delivery. Urban Motion Intelligence

✅Delhi faces severe congestion, unpredictable public transit demand & accident hotspots. ✅ISBT terminals & Metro stations experience peak-hour overcrowding. ✅Accident-prone zones like ITO, Dhaula Kuan, and Outer Ring Road pose safety risks. ✅Public transport inefficiencies push commuters toward private vehicles, worsening traffic.
